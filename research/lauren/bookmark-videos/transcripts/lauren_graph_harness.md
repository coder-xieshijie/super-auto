## 00:00:00

Hi everyone, I'm Lauren, Lauren Tan I guess not many people know my last name I am Potato on Twitter Potato with spelled with an E and I have been at Cursor for about five months previously I was at Meta where I worked on the React team specifically working on the React compiler which was a whole lot of fun I'm still on the on the core team and and, contributing to open source here and there

## 00:00:30

so that that's really nice that they still let me do that and before Meta, I was at Netflix where I was, both a tech lead and I transitioned to be be an engineering manager for about two years So I've had a I've had a lot of experience going between engineering management and being an individual contributor and I think something I've noticed actually which is quite interesting

## 00:01:00

is that there are so many parallels with you know management skills and how to like manage agents and that's actually a a big part about what I wanted to chat with you and everybody else about today but yeah, that's, that's me I do have some like very light slides but, it's not going to be just rambling. So let me just share my screen and hope that I don't leak anything

## 00:01:30

oh no, I need to allow permissions There's always tech, tech, tech trouble give me one second to rejoin Yeah, go for it I see many of you already know Lauren from the looks of the chat here So yeah it's exciting to get a chance to chat with her and go through some of her recent work As you guys heard you know a lot of recent experience from Netflix to

## 00:02:00

Meta and then now over at Cursor We're going to chat a little bit about Grokbot as well So that'll be exciting. I don't know if you guys saw that was a recent release I think literally maybe yesterday or the day before from the Cursor team which is kind of like let's call it like agents for everyone You can go check it out if you want and learn a little bit more about the product But yeah we'll explore that a little bit today as well Alrighty, welcome back

## 00:02:30

And Lauren you're just on mute there if you want to hop off and mute if you're chatting Yeah, sorry No worries It's 2026 and I still don't know how to use Zoom okay, so I assume you can see my screen Yes, yeah, we're good. So yeah today, yeah, I think I think the big theme for me as I've been using agents to write code and I'm sure a lot of you have

## 00:03:00

had the same experience as well is how do you trust it? You know especially if you are an engineer that's been writing code for a very long time you have a lot of opinions and lessons that you've learned about doing good engineering And when you see agents just you know, winging it and, you know, guessing, hallucinating, you know confidently stating that they found the smoking gun for the hundredth time but it's actually not the real problem

## 00:03:30

you lose a lot of trust And when you lose when you don't have much trust in your agents I feel like you you really can't get the most out of them And for me, the parallels like with management so if I'm an a manager, an engineering manager of a team and I have a bunch of you know, I have a team of engineers on my team, and I don't trust them then the mode of operation I'm going to be in is going to be like micromanagement right? I'll have to spend a lot of time looking over my report's shoulders and

## 00:04:00

checking that they're doing their work well you know that they're not shipping bugs to production And so I drew this chart because it's not, it's not a very scientific chart but like this is how I imagine myself and my journey through using agents So, you know, like fast forward or back forward or fast back, fast backwards like a year or so when

## 00:04:30

you know, nobody was or not many people were using agents to code I think you you get into this mode where you are In very heavily in the loop with one or several like a handful of agents and you find yourself just constantly fig you know, trying to understand what your agents are doing and you're very, very in the loop You're watching every single output You are sitting there prompting and you really can't parallelize beyond that because you don't

## 00:05:00

again, you don't have that trust right? You can't go to a hundred agents like spawn a hundred agents when you don't even trust the output of one agent So over the past five months I feel like I've really been able to like ascend this trust curve and now I'm at the point where I actually have, this sounds kind of scary to say this and it makes me sound like a slop artist but I, I promise I'm not

## 00:05:30

But I actually have my agents now auto-merging PRs for me which is like a wild thing to say but like I woke up today and there were like 20 PRs landed and I just reviewed them on main like they were already landed and they were good so how did I get to that point? It's basically what I wanted to talk about today and again, like, yeah feel free to jump in if you have questions Colin but, oh yeah, of course, I got to show this

## 00:06:00

this chart, where I don't do not trust Someone requested to control my computer probably won't do that but yeah, so this chart, I think, I, I I'm sharing this chart not to kind of like flex but to kind of show like the journey Like, so you can see like the curve like it it sort of like inversely matches the contributions I've been able to land at cursor

## 00:06:30

So I joined five months ago And five months ago like I, you know, my first month I was like not very productive because I was you know, I was learning the code base didn't know what the heck was going on And as I got more confident in in my agents I've really been able to kind of ramp up my productivity and again, like, yeah like last month I shipped a thousand PRs which is ridiculous and then this month we're only on the 12th I'm already at, like, almost 800 PRs landed

## 00:07:00

so the velocity is definitely high and you, you, I, I'm I fear a lot of you will definitely be questioning like, how how much of this code is actually good and I think, yeah, like, that's definitely fair to question but, yeah, I think I think if you set up your agents well you can definitely get to a very similar level and so I'm going to talk about how we do that

## 00:07:30

so for me, I think, I'm curious, like, I guess, Colin, your experience as well but, for me I think the most important skill that you should have in your toolbox when you work with agents is verification and by verification I mean the ability for an agent to actually run the code or take CPU traces or heap snapshots or

## 00:08:00

you know, open an iOS simulator whatever, you know, however your application is exposed to your users it can do the same thing and run it for real and actually test and verify its own work Because that's the thing that really closes the loop it doesn't guarantee your agent writes good code but it allows them to at least write correct code which is a big a really big step forward for being able to trust your agents

## 00:08:30

I will, I can share one example that we have within cursor oops, where, let me open this Let's make this bigger make my full screen There you go so for The, for Cursor's agent window

## 00:09:00

so this is actually an interesting story but, when I joined Cursor five months ago they're actually, well I was supposed to join a different team I was supposed to join like, the cloud agents team but then since I have a lot of experience working on React and agents window is a React application I was I was asked to basically help out with the agent window work but

## 00:09:30

There wasn't really a lot of like, skills to help me So I just found myself like okay Agent's Windows is going to launch in like a week Right, we have a really tight deadline And, there was, you know, I was just sitting there like okay, I'm going to open up the performant the, the Chrome DevTools and just like take a trace look at it myself and try to make sense of this flame graph And keep in mind I was just like in my first week So I had no idea what I was looking at No idea what, you know, I mean I had some idea

## 00:10:00

but, you know, the the code base was completely fresh to me and I realized like my agent had no idea either you know, like I would take a screenshot of the trail download the trace or send it to it and it'd be like yeah, it kind of looks like this you know and it would like confidently state like it's this thing and then I'd try to fix that and turns out that's not the actual thing So this was a very very slow process And if you've ever done any like performance work yourself or, you know just even development with an agent where you don't have a verification skill

## 00:10:30

you are the verifier right? You've, you're the bottleneck You, you, you tell your agent to do something and then it goes off and writes some code Then you open up your you know, local dev build, and then you start to say oh, you know, it doesn't work Then you got to copy paste screen you know, screenshots or console errors or whatever and then your agent like slowly kind of like you know works with that and then tries to understand it and fix the thing

## 00:11:00

But then you're constantly just in the loop and and being a bottleneck. So there's really no way to parallelize So the control glass skills are like one of the first skills I built for cursor and glass, by the way is the code name for agent's window that we use internally but it's just cursor I guess and so this skill is, I guess that the the code itself is not super interesting Your agent can very easily make one for you where if if you're building an electron app or a web app or even iOS

## 00:11:30

applications, you can teach your agent how to use like, the Chrome DevTools protocol or through Apple has some utilities as well for running the simulator and taking traces and controlling programmatic control as well so that's really useful but one thing I actually want to talk about is the this thing

## 00:12:00

or you have to read me so this skill comes with this very unique feature called or not feature unique file called a feature map And so the story then is like I built this skill and so now the agent was able to actually run the agent window and take traces and whatnot but it had no idea what What the agent's window was So, you know, like someone would say like oh, the the left sidebar is like laggy or something like that

## 00:12:30

Or, you know, the right side, the the PR tab is not working And the agent would just be like kind of flailing around. It would spend a lot of time trying to like look up the code and you know, where is this feature? How do I actually get to it on the UI? Which made it basically completely useless you know, like we would I would run this skill locally and you know, it would spawn a dev build but then it'd just be churning

## 00:13:00

Like I just try to click here It it wouldn't know how to get to things and it was just an awful experience so, who's putting arrows on my screen? so, Yeah, this, this feature map has been really useful because it teaches the agent how to get to all of the features that you have and in P-Stack, the plugin that I I've made, if you search for P-Stack cursor on Google you'll, you'll find it but there is a create verification skill in that plugin

## 00:13:30

where it actually helps you set up something like this for yourself including the feature map. So it will actually explore the code and build up this initial feature map that tells your agent how to get to all of the different features that you have and this is extremely powerful because now that you have these user reports that come in you you can actually map even like a vague report or even a screenshot So we have this internally at Cursor where

## 00:14:00

we have a Slack channel with you know lots of people giving us feedback on the agents window and Rockbot and whatnot and oftentimes the report is very bad like very low quality. Like someone will just put very often we get like a screenshot like, and then someone just says question mark question mark, question mark, like, what is this? And, you know, like, without this, your agents are like I have no clue right? But with a feature map like this it has a lot more context and understanding of how to actually navigate

## 00:14:30

how to get to all the different features so like, you know, example, like, I guess, like the sidebar, like what is the sidebar? you know like all the different sub features that are present in it like from the user point of view here's where to, how to get to it all the different keyboard shortcuts even like the, the what do you call it? The DOM elements or yeah like the attributes that you use for selecting things through the CDP

## 00:15:00

are all there So, again, yeah, this is like really really powerful, for, for agents and a P stack ships that create verification skill but also a maintain verification skill so you can keep this up to date Cool. Yeah. I was just going to ask how you created that. So do you mind sharing a little bit more about that that process in the context of P stack and maybe just what P stack is for the folks who aren't familiar? Yeah, so PStack is pretty interesting because

## 00:15:30

well, first of all, the name is kind of goofy Like, the P, the P in PStack is like potato potato stack, because I, so, there is a pretty famous person, Gary Tan, who is the CEO of Y Combinator and he's come up with this plugin called GStack GaryStack, and, funnily enough, we share the last name we have no relation

## 00:16:00

but I thought it'd be funny to kind of you know poke fun at Gary and make PStack my version of of, of, of his plugin but kind of just tailor it to my own set of engineering practices but I honestly actually never set out to build PStack it just started with a bunch of skills right? Like, I started with that control glass skill and then I started with another skill like called HAL, which I also noticed through like, Serving agents

## 00:16:30

so like, you know, in the early days of me you know, trying to climb this ladder I was like super in the loop and I was basically nitpicking my agents to an extreme degree I was like, I would tell it you know, this feature has stopped working Here's a bug report Like, why isn't it working? And very often, the agent would just like confidently state like oh, it has to be this right? It has to be this thing And I noticed like when I look at the actual tool calls I noticed it wasn't actually reading the code

## 00:17:00

that I thought should be affected And that made me just extremely suspicious And at that point I was just like I'm not gonna, I can't trust any this agent anymore because it's just it's just completely hallucinating And I think I think it's very easy to just you know, like build up that distrust and not and kind of feel helpless like, you know you don't know how to help your agents succeed But like, again, I think the, the the management analogy is super helpful because like

## 00:17:30

imagine if you were a manager of an engineering team and you had an engineer on your team who was a really good coder no business contacts whatsoever you know, they, they just, you just hired them and they they onboarded, you know, like five seconds ago and so how do you actually teach that person to be effective? So how you do that is through a skill skill being just, you know, it's just marked down right? But, you know, it encodes a lot of information instructions, a lot of

## 00:18:00

you can really draw out a lot of Intelligence from an agent by well, some people on Twitter call it like you know, pull the agent to a different latent space which is kind of like a fancy way of just saying like since, you know LLMs are sort of like they predict the next token when you give it some high quality tokens to begin with, then, you know, it it can kind of pattern match on like a higher space that's you know, smarter so that's like a very interesting model there

## 00:18:30

But yeah, I built PeaceStack very very incrementally so, started with just really observing how agents you know, all the fail, different failure modes of of that agents were having And every time I saw that I just, okay I'm just going to make that a skill Right, like stop hallucinating, actually go and search up look up the code use a lot of sub-agents and yeah, stop guessing Yeah, that makes sense. One one kind of follow-up question here

## 00:19:00

both from myself and from a bunch of people in the chat. So I guess it's two two parts. So one is like how do you maintain these skills? So like the product changes over time obviously there's a lot of people who should be against the code base So how do these skills get maintained? and then second to that is like how do you know when your verification is is good enough? like in you know you can trust that the verification loops that you've built are gonna I guess you trust that the outputs

## 00:19:30

when, when they're done. yeah maybe I'll talk about I think I have somewhat really maybe I'll start with this one first So like, how do I maintain these skills? So, if you're not familiar with this concept an eval is essentially like a way to well, I, the mental model I have is like it's like a unit test for an agent and, you can actually make your own evals You don't need like a special framework for them You can build, you can you can build one depending on like

## 00:20:00

you know how scientific and how rigorous you want to be my screen is red Yeah, there's a little button sorry Oh, you mean like disabling the drawing or something? I, I can't see my screen Yeah, sorry. If you guys could not draw on the screen that'd be great, but, there's a little button in the yeah, the, the little drop down Am I clear? Yeah. Okay yeah. You got it perfect Continue

## 00:20:30

Yeah, so evals are a way to unit test your skills basically And actually, in P-Stack, we ship under potato mode, there's a playbook, if you search for it called eval playbook and it's it's like not, it's actually pretty pretty rigorous, the way it's done but essentially what I do is I spawn a lot of different sub-agents I have, like, my main coordinator agent come up with a rubric for

## 00:21:00

what I want the skill to do And then it spawns all these sub-agents and it, it creates individual directories for them which are cleverly named to not let the sub-agent know that it's being evaluated because, agents can actually tell and when they do they change their behavior but it does a bunch of stuff like that to essentially, yeah like test whether or not the skill

## 00:21:30

I'm making or changing is actually doing what I think it does and one of the really nice things about Cursor is that we are we, we support so many different models so you can actually eval your skill across all sorts of different models and, you know get a sense of how well it performs across that different matrix especially for the models that you use so I do this a lot Every time I, I modify a skill I will run one of these

## 00:22:00

like the email playbook and make sure that you know it's actually leading to a result I want but I will say like Maintaining skills is actually pretty hard it requires, I think, a lot of taste and observation So you kind of need to be very good at being a backseat driver You know what I mean? Like, if you do pair if you've ever done pair programming for example, and you watch a coworker code and you just like you, you could probably do this better

## 00:22:30

You know, you could do, you know like, why did you not do this right? You, you ask a lot of questions to your coworker and it's kind of a similar thing here You like you don't want to just be a passive observer of the agent. You want to be very in the driver's seat in the initial stages when you're building up your own set of skills you know, obviously you can use something like DSAC but if you're building your own set of skills it's very, I think, you know, opening up the all the tool calls and like reading the code and reading all the the agent behavior and their thinking blocks is

## 00:23:00

a really great way to see where they they fail, right? Like what, what You know, where are they being done? And then you can go and build a skill for that And then with verification how you trust it is it's, I think it's also a very similar iteration loop where, you know like I actually did the same process for verifying the verification skill where I actually get So one thing that's interesting about evals is that you can sort of hill climb them

## 00:23:30

meaning that, your eval can produce a score right? a score that you can get your coordinator to produce but also you can have a judge agent of a different model to kind of cross-reference and make sure that the first model is not being biased right? The model that's judging all of the sub-agents that are running the thing but you can also like, hill climb So meaning that you can you can use, like, slash loop in cursor and you can say okay, keep looping on this eval

## 00:24:00

right, until everything is ten out of ten as an example and I did the same the basically the same approach with the control skill and so I kind of it was very, it was very hands-off actually so, you know, I, I kind of built I built that skill that way like the CLI in that skill and over time, it's gotten really good but yeah, it was definitely not super smooth At the beginning it required a lot of iteration And I think there's an analogy here for me

## 00:24:30

which is, well I make this analogy later in a different slide on my drawing here but I think of it like you know, as a, as a engineer now you're sort of more like like maybe a manager or the analogy I like is like you're like a a chef in a restaurant you know, you're the head chef you're not cooking all the food yourself anymore You have a team of cooks right? You have line cooks you have a sous chef

## 00:25:00

you have, you know, all these different stations and it's your job to really design the environment You know, you you're in charge of setting up the kitchen You're in charge of you know, like giving tasks to different people So yeah, it's a very interesting way of working but yeah, that's, that's how I basically built these verification skills Yeah, just, just one follow-up there on like I had to go try to go one layer deeper So are you, let's say we wanted to build

## 00:25:30

an eval or a skill for for something and we wanted to kind of get better on its own which is, is what I think you're suggesting are you doing that in like a work tree kind of isolated with like the sub agents and and then the reviewer agents and and all that? Is it happening like in some type of cloud hosted environment? Like what's the, the more, the practical steps? If I wanted to go do this and like set up a verification system for something what would I what would I do or where would I start?

## 00:26:00

I think that the best place to start is local because you can observe You can definitely observe what your agents are doing So, if you're building a verification skill for yourself I would definitely start local and just have your agent bring up the application whether it's like a CLI or a desktop app or whatever And so you can actually observe right? You can see how the agent is interacting with the the application You can see it you know, how it calls like the different APIs that

## 00:26:30

that allow it to interact with the the application but, for me personally I have basically been kind of all in mostly all in on cloud agents because they're extremely powerful and the really powerful thing about Cursor is the the cloud agents actually where if you spend a little bit of time setting up your environment These control skills these verification skills pay a

## 00:27:00

huge amount of dividends because it's not just something that makes you as a single engineer better it actually levels up your whole team and even your whole company because you can actually start thinking about cloud agents you can start thinking about automations that automatically do things like I'll, I get, I I kind of talk about this a bit later but I'll just kind of Get into it where, where, you know, for example, like I talk a lot about this agent we have called Benny

## 00:27:30

right, who, who, you know takes all of the bug reports that we get and it automatically goes off in the cloud opens up a cloud its, you know, its desktop It runs Cursor in its own computer and it uses the same control skills to interact with the application and try to reproduce the bug or the user report really. And this is so so powerful because at once I can immediately I I get so much information from this automatically

## 00:28:00

Like here in this example you can see that the Benny actually reproduced the bug but it's already fixed on main So it actually confirms that we fixed this problem already and all I need to do is just release another build of of cursor so that's like huge information there that I didn't have to go off and sit with an agent you know, and spend an hour trying to figure like is this fixed? Is this not fixed? So you, you, you gain back so much time but, you know everybody on my team benefits from this Everybody in the company benefits from this

## 00:28:30

so definitely think that you know, keeping these using cloud agents is super powerful but yeah, it's like a journey You have to trust it first right? Before you, you get to this point and that's, it goes back to what I was saying here where, you know, it's very hard, it's, it's almost impossible and I would definitely encourage you not to try to jump from you know, like, if you're still in this zone you don't want to jump to like, I'm going to spawn a hundred of thou

## 00:29:00

or thousands of cloud agents right now because you're just going to waste a lot of tokens and it's going to be Expensive Yeah, so just to kind of recap so far basically the if we wanted to go on the journey that you've kind of gone on it would be just start with verification building some, some skills and some some ways of determining that the agents are producing at least like correct code whether, like you said whether it's good code or not is maybe a separate question but like it's, it's technically solving the problem by looking at you know, stack traces, looking at, you know

## 00:29:30

the actual behavior in the app and so on And then once we trust it locally then we can start to think about scaling into the cloud and running more agents that are picking up signals I guess, on their own, right? So whether that's like a bug report that comes in or something they can go and pick it up and solve the problem and and give us back a PR And then maybe the last step is like auto merging the PRs which is where you're at maybe not where everyone is Yeah, yeah. And then reviewing them on main but is that, is that about right? Yeah, exactly. I think, yeah, that's why I drew this

## 00:30:00

this, this, this curve, right? Because that, this, this basically describes my journey of you know, when I started, barely could use a couple agents and I was just observing every single thing I think there's really no shortcut for going from here to there because this is really about your personal level of trust in agents right? obviously, you know, as a, as an engineer you don't want to just slot code into production So how do you actually build up that trust takes a lot of, I guess, taste and judgment

## 00:30:30

but, you know, like I think plugins like Pstack definitely can help you get up to speed much quicker and so I guess it's like if you trust me and you trust Pstack then in, by extension you can maybe trust your agents But if you don't trust me and I I definitely would not encourage people to blindly trust me you know if you build up your own set of skills that you can obviously you know take a look at PSAT and kind of fork it

## 00:31:00

make it your own improve the skills, definitely encourage that but for me, it's really all about it, it, it just keeps coming back to trust You know every one of us here in this chat have a different standard for engineering and there are different things that are important for us in our code base And when you are able to encode all of that into skills and you can verify that your agent is actually doing them that allows you to really kind of ascend this curve And

## 00:31:30

you know, start automating things there's another piece I wanted to talk about if there's... Yeah, go for it I'll, I'll pick up more questions as I go but yeah. I think there's a a third part to this which I haven't talked about yet which is kind of an interesting one which is like refactoring and rewriting Like one of the I guess most controversial one of the most controversial topics in the industry I think, is like should you rewrite your app or not? because I think engineers are very prone to this

## 00:32:00

where, especially when you join a company you come in and you see like the code base and you're like man, this is shit Like who wrote this code? You know, it's, it's terrible I want to rewrite the whole thing There is a very common inclination and I think a lot of you know, before agents, and I guess arguably even now people will definitely discourage you from rewriting stuff But I'm actually here to make a case for why you might want to consider it because

## 00:32:30

I think it really depends you know, brownfield applications, I think are actually in a pretty good spot especially if they're set up well already and like recently I've been talking to some people but, you know, I, I was just observing I, I just noticed this Parallel which is that a lot of big tech company problems are now everybody's problems And the big tech company problem you know, like when I was working at Meta like we had this giant monorepo

## 00:33:00

we had like, I don't know tens of thousands of engineers just you know, like banging on their keyboards and and shipping code And a lot of really great engineers at Meta but, I'll say like, you know you'll be surprised that the code quality is actually not that good and so I often joke that like you know, before AI slop, we had human slop and so, you know I think a lot of big tech infra like, like what Meta has or Google

## 00:33:30

you know, you know really big tech companies are actually designed for that where you're, you're sort of like you're catering to the the, you know, like, sounds, this sounds so bad to say but like the, the least capable engineer on your team right? You build, you build frameworks, you build conventions, you build guardrails You know, you restrict credentials so that you know, your intern doesn't wipe your production database there's, you know, if you have that level of infra already

## 00:34:00

I think your agents can actually already do a very solid job right? Because they have the the guardrails are already in place for agents to not cause havoc or not cause too much havoc in your codebase and you can always add more you know, guardrails but I think like Greenfield applications especially are, you know like the brand new applications are like the biggest risk in my opinion, and also the greatest opportunity Because, you know, if you vibe code a project

## 00:34:30

a prototype, like we did for Grokbot you know, Grokbot was spun up very very, very quickly and if you, if you haven't heard of of Grokbot, it's like a a new application we just launched yesterday it's, it's really cool lets you orchestrate your create like individual agents. Have their own identity and you can kind of orchestrate them It's super cool, definitely check it out but yeah, that was, it's like a very it was a very greenfield application like most prototypes are So it was like vibe coded very quickly

## 00:35:00

Humans were not reading the code at all And, I had this tweet recently where I said something about organic architecture maybe I'll find it but the idea is that when you have a completely vibe coded application you essentially have no guardrails whatsoever So, your agents When you give them a task they will just solve it in whatever method

## 00:35:30

is the most convenient. And over time you get into this situation where you have a code base that is spiraling out of control because you don't understand it your agents understand it I guess, in a way, but, like they've built something that is you know, optimized for short, for shortcuts and you know, it will, you will suffer you'll have a lot of of issues with that application so I think starting your code base with

## 00:36:00

like, very strong constraints is Very much needed because like when you have a code base that you can trust right, when you have guardrails that actually help you help your agents, right, good code, you can get into the you know, like into this part of the curve where I I, where I, like I, I said, you know I woke up today and I had like 20 PRs merged by my agents, and that's because I invested a lot a lot of time

## 00:36:30

over 600 PRs I, I, I calculated yesterday when I refactored all of GrokBot to this new architecture that I've been building and yeah, I've, I've gotten to a point where I I don't really look I really don't look at the code anymore and, I say that not just you know, to sell you tokens but Because I, you know it took a lot of work to get to that point. I spent a lot of tokens to get the codebase to this point where I no

## 00:37:00

longer have to look at it But I'm very excited because you know, of the potential where you know, it's not just it just doesn't just benefit me It benefits everyone contributing to GraphBot and it also empowers you know, designers and product managers and you know, people even GTM people to add features to GraphBot And I don't have to worry you know I don't have to wake up at night in the middle of the night and worry like oh shit, someone's just merged a perf regression right? I have a ton of constraints and CI

## 00:37:30

It's like, it's actually very annoying to write code in GraphBot but like agents absorb all of that annoyance But yeah I'm happy to talk about what exactly that is Yeah, I think one question Before we get into the this part here is just around that element of like what your your, your CI looks like or maybe some of the constraints and then also like the average PR size I saw a question about that earlier Just to give people a you know, kind of a, a glance

## 00:38:00

It doesn't have to be like mathematically average but just, you know, like what generally the size of the a PR is if it's only a couple lines of code or you know, yeah. I think it depends Maybe I'm trying to do this in a way where I'm not gonna like Yeah, you don't have to share the actual numbers like the actual average. No I think this is fine But like we have so okay, this is not that interesting but well

## 00:38:30

fun fact is that virtualization in Grokbot and in Cursor is actually powered by Pretext which is a sort of new library that someone's built that's really interesting. You should you should check it out But that's not really that important I think the average PR size I actually don't know my I don't know if I want to click on these I probably can but I would say like they can range anywhere from a few hundred lines or 50 lines to like a thousand

## 00:39:00

depending on what the thing is doing so like here, I'm actually like deleting a bunch of files so I expect that it's just just like mostly deletion but yeah, it, it kind of varies There's no like, there's no like hard cap or whatever they're all like 50 line PRs There's no hard cap there's definitely no hard cap but I I do encourage my agents to split up their work into multiple PRs I do that mostly because I like, I like the idea of the

## 00:39:30

I guess maybe this is much harder to do now as in the world of agents and you have like so many commits but I like the idea that you know the Git history is a very rich source of context and I like the I like each PR to sort of atomically describe what that small piece of thing is doing which also makes it easier for me to revert changes and like figure out you know, oh, I shipped a bug and it's this it's here right? It's not in this 40,000 line PR where who knows what

## 00:40:00

landed in there but I I don't have a hard cap on PR size Cool. And then, yeah also quick question on like CI So again, you don't have to go into like the screen share like your your CI does, but just generally would you describe what the CI kind of looks like or how strict it is? yeah, so, well, specifically for Grokbot, so Dune is the is the sort of cheeky code code name for the architecture that we've built

## 00:40:30

for Grokbot the CI looks pretty annoying because there's checks for everything So, like, literally I have, well, if you've read any React for example, you know you know that one of the biggest foot guns in React is useEffect so in Dune and in Grokbot we've banned use effect So Dune is just an you get the the mental model of what Dune is you can kind of think of it as like Next.js for

## 00:41:00

electron apps and it's designed for agents to write and it's like custom for you know, our agent powered applications so the CI checks are very like specific to that like, you know, don't use use effect It's, it's, it's banned, like CI will fail and yell at you We have like some of the more interesting ones that people might raise eyebrows is like I actually ban code comments as well which is very interesting but I've noticed that ninety-nine percent of the time

## 00:41:30

agents just write code comments that kind of describe some historical thing that is actually totally irrelevant to the code like it will often say like you know, oh, Lauren said you should never do this and it's now in in a code comment. Like what? Like why? That, that was I didn't say that as like a Global you know global rule. I just met like your this PR sucks and you should change that part My agents don't really understand this that well surprisingly

## 00:42:00

and or they kind of assume too much and they kind of do things in like very stupid ways So like, yeah, we just ban everything Everything you can imagine like the agents are bad at we ban so one example that we actually suffer a lot in the agents window is we have you know, if you've used agents window you've definitely seen performance issues and you know, we're constantly trying to fix them but it's like a It's a never-ending struggle because there's so many pull requests that get merged

## 00:42:30

Every any one of them could just regress performance or stability or reliability you know the agents window doesn't have this architecture yet I plan to do bring this learning back there and kind of refactor everything there but, it just regresses super often because, there's, just one example is like we have very poor isolation between processes So like on, you know, on, on Electron you have a renderer thread that renders your UI

## 00:43:00

but you also have like a main thread that you can run other code that you know, doesn't need to block the renderer but we do a poor job of separating those things and so oftentimes you just accidentally have code that gets pulled into running on the renderer thread and then all of a sudden you're competing with the the renderer that, you know, that has a very if you want like 60 FPS you have to every frame that gets drawn has to be done in 16 milliseconds So very, very small, you know, deadline per frame

## 00:43:30

if you want, you know a very smooth product and when you start building bringing in, accidentally bringing in, you know things that are like very computationally heavy or they have a lot of IO then you just get into like a lot of jank And your, your FPS really drops you start, you know, losing frames you get long tasks that take more than 16 milliseconds and you just get this really choppy experience So all of those patterns that we've learned basically building electron apps

## 00:44:00

we've encoded into this framework and it becomes like a hard failure So I literally, in, in Grokbot we literally have a directory called electron main electron renderer, and we have, import, CI, I guess where we actually check the dependency graph to make sure they're not accidentally importing code from one directory to another so that's enforced by CI as well as BugBot which is our, which cursors

## 00:44:30

like code review tool that runs on CI you know, in our agents MD it's everywhere, like, so I, I, I I have this thing here where I I talk about like you know, like there are multiple layers I think, for building a good code base obviously the code base is one where if you have an architecture like this where it's extremely strict you know, the, the the way to build features is very conventional

## 00:45:00

That's like the strongest strongest level of enforcement because agents just love to copy existing patterns So one example of this in Robot is like we have this these concepts called like a feature and we have entry points and transcript cards like all, you know the cards that you see in the chat These are all like like nouns, I guess, in, in the framework And so there's a very conventional way of creating them And So like a feature is all in in a single directory as an example

## 00:45:30

And so all of the code that contributes to that feature lives in one directory So it's all co-located in one place Makes it super easy. You know agents don't have to like grab around and try to figure out like where all the things are It just looks at the feature and like oh, okay I'm working on the onboarding feature in Grokbot I'm just going to work in this directory And for 80% of the work it's mostly just very encapsulated there But, like, it's like very, it's like designed again for

## 00:46:00

you know, like the dumbest agent like you don't have to think right? The, the, the one of the key principles I have for this framework is like the shortest the shortest path is the best path So because that plays exactly to how agents love to write code. Like they like to take shortcuts really. You know, they'll they'll find the quickest way to solve the problem. So why not make that the best way to solve the problem? so, I, I I probably won't get into all the specific details

## 00:46:30

and, the this framework's really more of a collection of ideas and principles rather than something that will open source. you can you can, you know, screenshot this, I guess, if you want, and tell your agent to do some, build, build something like this for you too yeah, but it's really all about the layers you know, like the the code base is one part with features and directories and, you know, import, blocking import dependencies, that shouldn't be imported

## 00:47:00

but, and, and it all enforces that and static analysis So, like, there's CI checks we have a lot of lint for bad patterns We observe, compiler diagnostics there's also rules in Bogbot which are, I think like three four, five are more soft right? These two actually make make CI red, right? So that, you know there's a hard constraint where the agent can

## 00:47:30

just write crappy code For rules and skills in Bogbot Your agents can still forget right? You can still or it may not always consistently apply them So I like to layer them but I don't I don't like to rely on them as the only source of enforcement because it's very very soft, right? And if you if you only have rules and bugba and skills and a style guide for your code you will it's only a matter of time before your

## 00:48:00

code base looks like complete trash I'm sorry to say that but, I definitely recommend, yeah, like, you know, investing in, you know, things that can be hard enforced right? And this is why you know, maybe the choice of tech stack that you use is also very important Like I think, for example, Rust is sort of making you know, it's like getting super popular again because the compiler is so strict right? The compiler enforces so many different things

## 00:48:30

you know, there's a borrow checker that you have to appease and as long as you make sure your agents don't write unsafe code blocks you can more or less feel somewhat confident that if the code compiles it probably works and it's good but usually it gives you that level of trust and confidence that you as a human engineer no longer need to go and check it yourself You know you rely on code and static analysis to actually make that

## 00:49:00

a lot smoother and I, I guess the worst part the worst place to be in is if you are stuck in code review land where you actually enforce all of the constraints the invariants in your code base by literally the human person saying you know, reading the code and Hey you should not do this right? Every time you have to do that you should consider that as a code smell like a, a, a anti-pattern, and you should say okay, instead of me commenting on the PR

## 00:49:30

how do I turn this into a hard rule right? How do I turn this into a lint rule? How do I turn this into a CI failure? Or how do I even categorically eliminate this problem entirely? I, I can talk about another migration I've done but I'll probably pause here Sure. Yeah, I feel like that's that's where I am to be honest, is, is what you're describing right now which is that, like, I don't have all of these rules so I have some things to go do after this session in terms of being able to scale my agents I'm, I'm definitely on, like, the

## 00:50:00

you know, maybe a couple of parallel ones locally staged like two to three locally and I'm sure most people here are on the same So, yeah I know we only have a couple minutes left Lauren, was there anything else that you wanted to to highlight? I, obviously, there's lots of questions so I can grab more but I want to give you a few minutes if there's anything else you want to talk about. Been yapping for quite a lot so maybe let's just do questions Okay, cool. One question that had a couple of came up a couple of times was just around like token usage. So the question is like

## 00:50:30

is what you're describing a realistic thing for people who are on you know, a normal set of token usage they don't have, you know basically unlimited tokens to work with? I think that's a really good point I mean, like obviously, you know I work at a AI lab where we have unlimited tokens so I definitely cannot say that you know this is something everyone should do in the exact same way that I did it I think it's possible to get to this point without

## 00:51:00

you know, breaking the bank But, you know, if you're like an engineering leader or you know, you're, you're, you have a startup that you lead I think to me it's a question of ROI and it's like, yes you spend a lot of money on tokens in the upfront stage You know like refactoring your code base is going to take a lot of tokens adding all these things is going to take a bunch of tokens But if we're heading to a world where agents are writing all the code

## 00:51:30

and, you know, you want to be very lean right? You don't want to have to hire you don't want to be you don't want to become like meta right? Like, I mean, like in terms of you don't want to become a 10,000 person engineering org because I mean that's a cool problem to have but also, you know you have so much overhead There's like planning, you know, like, it's, it's, personally, I, I wouldn't it's not super fun. But I think you want to stay very nimble right? And you want to

## 00:52:00

you want to be like agents are all about allowing you to do things that you couldn't do before That's really, to me, like, the value of agents You know it's not just throwing tokens on every single little thing But, to me, like, the thing I couldn't do before is like, enforce this level of constraints in a codebase by myself right? Like, I'm just a single person you know it would have taken me years to build this framework and do all the refactoring

## 00:52:30

and Test everything myself and verify you know, like run, imagine if there, it was just me right? No, in, in pre-agent era just like running, you know, by my it would take me so long right? And my salary is pretty high right? Like, so, you know, the the question I think an engineering leader might have is just then you know, like, what is, there's a trade-off of do you hire someone to do this or do you spend the tokens to set up a code base so that even the the most naive, right

## 00:53:00

the dumbest agents can do a good job? And when you actually get to this point like even agents that are not you know, fable size do an excellent job of writing code and this pays a lot of dividends as well for me personally where I have empowered not just myself but again, like PMs, designers engineers who are not familiar with GraphBot to just contribute in a way that is sustainable So I think, yeah it's definitely like a trade-off for sure

## 00:53:30

You know, like nothing's like free for sure and tokens are pretty expensive but oh, actually, I, I I don't know how many of you have seen this but we actually announced Grok 4.6 today So very exciting, finally out so yeah, Grok 4.6 would be like a great it's very, very smart it's really good on the on the benchmarks and it's the same the tokens, well, hopefully I'm not saying this incorrectly but I believe the cost

## 00:54:00

per token is the same as 4.5 So you're actually getting more intelligence for the same cost I think this is an area that Cursor tries to Cursor and SpaceX AI try to really optimize for like that Pareto frontier of you know, cost versus intelligence you know we don't necessarily want to build the biggest model ever because that is extremely expensive to run It's really about like how do you find that sweet spot? You don't, you don't need a giant model but it's just super smart

## 00:54:30

right? And it's not very expensive for inference but, yeah, I think to kind of round it up I think it's like a it's, it's, there's a, if you do your own analysis I feel like it's pretty positive It'll it'll be pretty positive that the ROI you get from investing in stuff like this just empowers not just yourself but your whole team to be so much more productive right? Like imagine if you have an army of engineers like me who are shipping so much improvements and

## 00:55:00

and bug fixes, you know, every day, right? Like, that is pretty exciting Cool one last question before we wrap up this one is for the people in product on the on the call So let's say we do have a number of engineers who are shipping like Lauren I'm just curious, like how is the product team or other functions of your company keeping up given that, like, if you're shipping so quickly have, have are they using AI more to do their jobs? Like, as much as you can speak to that

## 00:55:30

and obviously you don't have like, you're not in that role but just curious about how that works I think this is where Grokbot has been actually exceedingly powerful where, so before Grokbot, like, you know obviously cursor only had cursor like we only had agents window we had a CLI we had an IDE and these are really like power user tools right? They, they're designed for developers so it's very, very developer-centric You can do knowledge work in them but it, like

## 00:56:00

the UI is not really optimized for that So we actually didn't really have well, I think like a lot of people like you know, GTM product, like they might have used cursor to do their work but it definitely wasn't like a delightful experience for them I think now with Grokbot it's become Grokbot is basically like their cursor moment for people who are not in tech in my opinion. Like it's like it's like a very very accessible way to use agents in a very comfortable

## 00:56:30

very familiar interface. It looks like iMessage and it's very fun too you know you can give your agent a fun name you can have you can kind of do orchestration within a very like natural way where you can sort of you know each agent's like a person and now you got a team of agents like working on you have one one agent per account that you manage as an example Or if you're a PM you have, you know you can have an agent that summarizes all the work that Lauren did last night And then now you know what I did

## 00:57:00

right? So I think our PMs are leveraging that a lot and their shipping code too so, you know, like oftentimes they will just say "Oh, here's a bug, I fixed it Can you look at it?" And then I'll go review it and actually it's just perfect I'm like,"Okay, stamped." so, that, I think that shows that you know, the, the dune architecture is holding up right? The, all the the really strict constraints allow people who are not experts in engineering to contribute at a high level so I'm I feel like I'm already seeing

## 00:57:30

that pay off a lot where you know, designers and PMs are just able to to, to ship features directly and that just makes The GrokBot team super fast right? Where we can ship so quickly and we have a lot planned so I'm very excited to, you know, to, to ship more, ship more stuff Yeah, that's awesome we are at time so, I guess, Lauren, if, if folks want to support you

## 00:58:00

maybe go try out GrokBot try out, 4.6 and, you know, to get, to get, provide some feedback But yeah, this was awesome Really appreciate you taking the time thanks everyone for all the messages in the chat. lots of good questions I know we didn't get through everything but, as I kind of said at the top way more questions than than we could get through But, yeah, really, really thanks, thanks for for joining. Thanks everyone for joining and, hopefully you, you enjoyed the session Yep Yeah, I see Thanks for having me and, if you have any more questions yet just DM me on Twitter I'll, I'll open them up

## 00:58:30

I guess, let the, let the puppies You're gonna get, you're gonna get a lot of DMs Yeah, I'll open the puppies So yeah, DM me, maybe I'll do, like a Twitter space at some point as well for more questions but really appreciate everyone for showing up you know, taking an hour out of your day Yeah, alright, thanks all. I'll see you the next one Thanks, everyone. Bye
